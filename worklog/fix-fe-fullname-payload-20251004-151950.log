[Summary]
- Frontend update/create requests did not include `fullName`; they only set `firstName` to the edited "姓名" field. Backend resolves full name from `firstName` correctly, but added debug shows cases where downstream tools expect an explicit `fullName` field.
- Initial form `fullName` value preferred `firstName`/`lastName` over `user.fullName`, which could display an outdated value and complicate change detection in some edge cases.

[Changes]
- Send both `fullName` and `firstName` on create/update from admin webapp.
  - File: source/dts-admin-webapp/src/admin/views/user-management.modal.tsx
  - CreateUserRequest and UpdateUserRequest now include `fullName` fields.
  - Types extended: source/dts-admin-webapp/src/types/keycloak.ts
- Prefer `user.fullName` when initializing the modal full name field.
- Backend now logs FE payload name fields and the resolved command values for cross-check.

[Verify]
- Edit a user's 姓名 only; submit. Watch logs:
  - FE payload(updateUser) names: firstName=..., lastName=..., fullName=...
  - Resolved(updateUser) command: ... fullName=...
- The approval payload should include updated `fullName` in "after" section.
